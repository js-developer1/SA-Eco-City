                You may be asking yourself, why should we care about sustainability? 
                Well, sustainability allows for our environment to survive for future generations. 
                We must be sustainable to the resources we have around us like water, lumber, land, etc. 
                Reason being, if we aren’t being sustainable to the resources we have around us, we will run out of those resources and will have to find more. 
                Usually when a country runs out of a resource they often import it which can cost a lot of money. 
                In the most extreme cases, countries go to war over the resource not only costing more money, but also innocent lives. 
                So being sustainable can stop a lot of hassle in the future. 
                That’s why sustainability is so important.

                Another way you can help is by try and being sustainable in your environment.
                Try reducing, recycling, reusing, and not using resources on useless things.
