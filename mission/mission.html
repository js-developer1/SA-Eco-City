                    As part of the green innovation project, the South African government has asked us to discuss and create a sustainable city based on their research to tackle systemic sustainability problems within South Africa.
                    We are targeting a specific place within Western Cape, that borders a city called George, Cape. 
                    There are a few major problems we’d like to address within our preview, including social sustainability, access to proper healthcare and education.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Within the area near George, there are a lot of illiterate people with only 50 schools for the entire region of George. 
                    Of those 50, 34 of those schools are no-fee schools which means 16 schools require fee’s but those 16 schools offer proper education required to get into college. 
                    This is a sad but true reality of George and is limiting the access for people to reach their full potential. 
                    This also affects the economy of the surrounding area since there aren’t many young people who can do the corporate job and more old people will have to take on those jobs, which won’t be effective. 
                    These problems fall under social sustainability and economic sustainability and are something that we plan to conquer. 
                </p>

                    Another problem lies within the healthcare system of George. 
                    According to the data from the national government of Cape, George has only 2 functional ambulances for every 10 000 people! 
                    That means for its population of 200 000, there are only 40 functional ambulances but are barely accessible since not many people have access to technology. 
                    There's also only 1 regional hospital, 1 district hospital and 10 PHC fixed help sites within George. 
                    All these things increase the death rate since not many people can get the care they need in time to survive. 
                    It’s a serious issue that will be carefully looked at to ensure better accessibility to all.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Along with these problems, we face many other problems in George such as fee-based basic service delivery which prevents people from getting access to free stuff such as water, sanitation and electricity. 
                With all these in mind, our team is motivated to bring sustainable solutions to the surrounding areas of George.
